## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
For the program to work correctly, create a folder `/security` in the main directory and add the file `dadata.ts` with your API key from the [service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dadata)
```javascript
// dadata.ts
export const DADATA_API = 'YOUR_DADATA_API_KEY'
```
